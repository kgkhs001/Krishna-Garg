## Bio
I am a sixteen year old Junior attending Kennett High School in North Conway. My main focus is Computer Science in which I am proficient having completed many projects along side teammates and independently. I am skilled at using coding languages 'C' and 'javaScript'. I also have a working understanding of HTML and CSS and am proficient in reactNative. 

## My Projects 
### The Tax Calculator Project

### Brief Description
While working in CS50 I was able to gather enough knowledge about the coding language 'C' that I began to work on my own projects. So I decided to work on one big project to end the year.
I decided to work with 'C' in order to make a tax calculator. I had never really understood how taxes worked so this seemed like a great opportunity to extend my knowledge and apply coding
to a real life issue. This tax calculator uses arrays, if else statements, and lists in order to calculate a persons tax amount based on their social status and income. 

### How it Works
Basically the code gathers inputs such as income and what tax bracket the person would fall under then based on those inputs runs the income through certain if statements that multiply the income by percentages. 

### Problems Encountered During Project
One of the problems I encountered during the making of this project was the size and length of the code. The code below is the condesed version of the original code. Originally the code for this calculator was extremley long and would have been extremley difficult to manage. But with the help of some friends and my teacher I was able to create an algorithm that both made the code easier to mange and easier to read. I was able to make this algorithm using arrays and lists, saving them as variables, and then running the variables through functions I designed myself.

## A Themed Arcade Website
### Brief Description
Using Django, our team was able to build a responsive themed spirit week website. Inside of this website was a fully functional arcade with 4 classic games that were coded by individuals in the group. This project was created for the spirit week of the school I was attending. Because it was for the school the website had login usernames and passwords for all of the students who used it. We set up a database that could hold all of this information. The population of the group was slit up into four seperate teams the handled each aspect of the code.

### Problems Encountered
Some of the problems encountered while creating this project were making a leaderboard, updating a leaderboard, saving login information, and checking login information. I was apart of the functionality team that dealt with these kinds of problems. Fortunatley Django had a swear checker that we implemented while fixing the checking login problem. Django also had a saving log in information function in their library. So the only problem left was setting up and updating the leaderboard automatically. This was solved by extensive research and some magic done in Python by some exceptional individuals in the group.

## Virtual Air Hockey
### Brief Description
Virtual Air Hockey was an add on to the themed website. It was one of the arcade games that went into the over all project. To create this project my partner and I used p5 which is an extension of javascript which is made for more artistic and game like code. But even p5 does not have the necessary logic and physics needed to create a game like virtual air hockey. To incorporate the necessary logic and physics into the code my partner and I found a p5.play library which allowed us to use physics concepts like velocity into our code, in turn making it seem more and more like actual air hockey. This game kept score and increased velocity with every hit. It is a one player game in which the user faces off against an ai.

### Problems Encountered
During the games creation there was an issue that the game started as soon as the page opened up. To fix this we incorporated states into our code which made it so that the user would have to click in order to start any motion in the game. Adding states was difficult to do once we had finished the code since we had to go back and modify the whole code to allow states to take action.

## Cube Slasher
### Brief Description
Using p5 and the p5.play library I designed a two dimensional game in which the player moves around using the mouse in order to destroy cubes the shoot up from the bottom of the screen. This game implemented concepts such as velocity, add, states, overlap(), etc... into the code to make the movements of objects seem more organic and pleasing asthetically. 
### Problems Encountered
The only major problem that was encountered was implementing the concept of destroying the blocks everytime that they were touched by the players sprite. This problem was eventually solved by the use of an if statement and the overlap function. Using this function and condition I was able to say that if the players sprite overlaps with the cube then run a "getPoints" function that adds 5 points to the score and removes the cube from the screen.
